You're only popular because you like to embarrasse yourself but that's okay nerds are pretty smart, too. Here's some advice that I hope you will use some day and that's to not try so hard at being popular and stop acting like you know every little thing about anything.  Also if someone ever asks for something like copying your homework or something like that, then it means that they're taking advantage of you and making you think that you're one of them or that they're your friends, but you're not sweetie. So open your eyes, stop trying to be involved with every thing and just sit back and chill, and don't think just because your so smart and you make good grades all the time it means that you're a loser or you're lame. Don't let anyone say something like that to you. You're smart and that's the best thing in the world.";

And if you're dating someone, I sure hope you're treating them with respect and giving them all of your attention unless they don't do that to you. If I'm wrong about how fit you are then I hope you're still healthy.  Stay fit and healthy, that usually helps you live longer but who knows. Just don't smoke because that's stupid and it's just not cool at all. If anyone thinks something like that is cool then they're stupid and pathetic and probably won't even live that long anyways but oh well that's their choice and their lives that they're wasting.

And if you're a girl, then you're probably the kind that likes to wear shirts that are 10x bigger than your original size with shorts or tights and you like that messy bun hair style, don't you.  Yes you do don't lie. And you're probably the kind to have selfies as their background for their phones, which pretty much shows how pathetic and full of yourself you are. I don't judge but that's pretty annoying.  You probably even have snapchat with like a thousand streaks or something and I bet your pretty proud of that because you have no other talent or way to waste your time."

And by the way you may say it's your phone but you only have the right to say that if you bought it with your own money that you worked so hard for, but if you didn't and say the things that your parents bought is yours then you're just lying to yourselves. All of that stuff you have is borrowed, honey. Your parents bought it with their money so you're only just borrowing it.

That's okay I don't judge. You're probably the kind of person who cuts themselves for no reason, only for attention maybe, but I doubt you do that because your life sucks because it probably doesn't. Or maybe you're not emo, maybe you're the kind of person who says that your life sucks for no reason. Don't be mad or sad because you didn't get what you want or your crush doesn't like you back. Who cares about that, it's not the end of the world or anything so shut up you depressing idiot. Just move on with your life and be happy otherwise don't say anything at all and keep your mouth shut.

That's too bad though because you still have to go to school and get a good education for yourself. And if you're the kind of person who's cool with working at Walmart or something, then I'm guessing you're also cool with getting paid less which means you can't buy all of the food and stuff you want because you have to worry about paying your rent and phone bills and all of that stuff."
